# LLEMA: Accelerating Materials Design via LLM-Guided Evolutionary Search (ICLR 2026)

## About

LLEMA is a unified framework that accelerates materials discovery by coupling the scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. 

## Key Features

- **LLM-Guided Generation:** Leverages scientific knowledge in LLMs to propose chemically plausible material candidates
- **Chemistry-Informed Evolution:** Integrates domain-specific operators for compositional substitution and crystal structure manipulation
- **Memory-Based Refinement:** Maintains reward and error buffers to guide exploration across generations
- **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Balances multiple property constraints including thermodynamic stability and synthesizability
- **Validated on 14 Tasks:** Spanning electronics, energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace applications

## Results

LLEMA discovers materials that are:
- ✅ Chemically plausible and thermodynamically stable
- ✅ Property-aligned with target specifications
- ✅ Synthesizable for experimental realization
- ✅ Superior to generative and LLM-only baselines in hit-rates and Pareto fronts
